Exploration of the Relationship Between Climate Change Beliefs and Personal Experiences

The success of carbon emissions reduction plans relies on changes in individual behaviour, 
facilitated through strategies like nudges, information dissemination, and shifts in attitudes. 
Lack of concern about climate change can hinder participation in such efforts. Understanding 
how people perceive climate risks is pivotal for emission reduction. Our study employed kmodes cluster analysis to examine public perceptions across countries using climate change 
survey data from 2020 to 2022. We identified distinct attitude clusters in waves 1 and 2 
(2020-2021) - "Alarmed," "Concerned," "Cautious," and "Dismissive." In wave 3 (2022), we 
found 5 clusters - "Alarmed," "Concerned," "Neutral," "Cautious," and "Dismissive." The 
"Alarmed" cluster is deeply worried, urgent, and supportive of action. The "Concerned" 
cluster worries but with slightly less urgency. The "Cautious" cluster is moderately worried 
with moderate urgency. The "Disengaged" cluster is minimally worried and inactive. The 
"Neutral" cluster acknowledges worry, openness, and no direct impact. Clusters shifted 
across waves; "Cautious" moved toward "Concerned," "Alarmed" grew and declined, and 
"Disengaged" expanded. Three models, including logistic regression, random forest, and 
support vector machine, were utilized to classify respondents based on their personal 
experience of climate change. From these options, a simpler model was selected. Findings 
indicate a need for targeted public campaigns on climate change risks.
